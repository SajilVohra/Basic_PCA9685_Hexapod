# Basic_PCA9685_Hexapod
A arduino based Hexapod which was coded in less than 8 hrs and can be made for high-school projects !

The hexapod contains a 16-channel servo driver for driving 16 9g servo motors. There are 18 servo motors (6x3(each leg)) ; out of which 2 of them are directly attached to arduino uno.THE LIBRARY USED FOR PCA9685 SERVO DRIVER IS PROVIDED BY ADAFRUIT. 

The hexapod code has functions for different movement, which are executed by a random number (generated by "random(x,y)" funtion in arduino) assigned with each movement. 

Files for 3D printing are also included for constructing the body.

THE HEXAPOD IS NOT MEANT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PROJECTS! MEANT FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN ONLY AS MINIMAL MATHEMATICS IS USED FOR DESIGNING !
